I do miss going for runs.\n\n# Currently\n\nI've participated in (been the head of) more clubs in the last 2 years than my entire life. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products. I like where I'm headed.\n\n# Some history\n\n- At 4, I didn't want to go to school without getting Mario the princess for level 9893420934. The brilliant solution : slip my father's phone in my bag, and finish it in my school break. Cutting to recess, I promptly ran to the playground to catch the first ride on my favourite swing : all memory of the phone gone. No, I did not put the ringer on silent.\nNeedless to say, it wasn't a great first parent teacher meeting. 13 years later, I learnt how to build  Mario in my first week of CS50.\n\n- My mother decided to pursue her Master's in Computer Applications when I was 5. It was then that I was introduced to the world of computers.\n\n- In the summer of 2010, my uncle purchased GTA for me (Vice city I think) and installed it on my mom's computer. I might have endangered her degree by using her computer too much.\n\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Singing\n- Playing guitar\n- Reading\n- Winter\n- Colored pencils ([Faber-Castell Polychromos](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/art-and-graphic/polychromos))\n- Podcasts ([Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money),  [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have a list of a hundred ideas, like an alarm clock for your night, locking your phone / netflix to make sure I sleep on time (As you can see , they aren't always the best).\n- I almost always have coffee with me.\n- I can't locate every country on a map.\n- I actively mine for Pi with terrible returns.\n- I am a terrible driver.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- doing better than yesterday\n- finding meaning in my work\n- getting out of my house\n\n\n# Websites from people I admire\n\n- [Alex Peysakhovich](http://alexpeys.github.io/)\n- [Chris Lengerich](http://www.chrislengerich.com/)\n- [Chris Saad](https://www.chrissaad.com/)\n- [Duncan Tomlin](http://duncantomlin.com/)\n- [Hawley Moore](http://hawleymoore.com/)\n- [Holman Gao](https://golmansax.com/)\n- [Ian Webster](http://ianww.com/)\n- [Johanna Flato](https://www.johannaflato.com/)\n- [Judy Mou](http://www.judymou.com/)\n- [Kristina Monakhova](https://kristinamonakhova.com/)\n- [Noah Trueblood](http://notrueblood.com/)\n- [Ruoxi Wang](http://ruoxiw.com/)\n- [Tom Sachs](https://www.tomsachs.org/)\n\n",l=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(i.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(h.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Harsheen Rajpal",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(s.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
