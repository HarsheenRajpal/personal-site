# Intro

I am a student who secretly might have  gotten used to ( and now likes quarantine ). I do miss going for runs.

# Currently

I've participated in (been the head of) more clubs in the last 2 years than my entire life. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products. I like where I'm headed.

# Some history

- At 4, I didn't want to go to school without getting Mario the princess for level 9893420934. The brilliant solution : slip my father's phone in my bag, and finish it in my school break. Cutting to recess, I promptly ran to the playground to catch the first ride on my favourite swing : all memory of the phone gone. No, I did not put the ringer on silent.
Needless to say, it wasn't a great first parent teacher meeting. 13 years later, I learnt how to build  Mario in my first week of CS50.

- My mother decided to pursue her Master's in Computer Applications when I was 5. It was then that I was introduced to the world of computers.

- In the summer of 2010, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.


Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
